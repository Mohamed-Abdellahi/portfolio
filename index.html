    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Financial Markets (Master 203) at UniversitÃ© Paris Dauphine, with a solid background in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science. My journey into the world of finance has been driven by a strong passion for markets, combined with a desire to bridge quantitative analysis, technology, and financial decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my internship in the Repo and Fixed Income Structuring team at Natixis CIB, I was responsible for conducting a full review of repo haircuts in collaboration with traders. This involved stress testing, liquidity analysis, and detailed data work to support the reduction of haircut levelsâ€”ultimately approved by the credit committee. I also priced various instruments including classic repos, bond forwards, and TRS, and supported the sales team with tailored roll strategies and product memos. To improve efficiency, I developed Python and VBA tools that automated 80% of daily tasks, from data scraping and statistical computation to report generation. This experience strengthened my knowledge of fixed income products, market infrastructure, and inter-team coordination between trading, sales, and risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently, I joined the Credit Algo Trading team at CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB as an intern, where I focused on developing systematic relative value strategies in corporate and financial bonds. I worked on designing signals and statistical models to capture mean-reverting behavior and basis dislocations, particularly within investment grade and financial issuersâ€™ capital structures. I used Python and Q/Kdb extensively, both for data analysis and building real-time monitoring tools for traders. I also contributed to research efforts around model interpretability and robustness, ensuring practical applicability on the desk. In addition, I helped traders handle post-trade analytics and automate repetitive monitoring processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two experiences gave me hands-on exposure to both the structuring and systematic trading sides of the sell-side, deepening my understanding of financial products and the technological backbone that supports decision-making. What I particularly value is the ability to work at the intersection of quantitative research, market intuition, and execution efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional background, Iâ€™ve also been involved in communication and content creation within my masterâ€™s program. I first contributed as a financial columnist, writing market-focused articles and helping produce our weekly financial newsletter. Today, I lead a team of three within the communication division, where I coordinate with other departments to promote key student-led initiatives. These include high-impact events such as the 2023 and 2024 Banking Treks, the 2024 Conference, and both the 2024 and 2025 Master 203 Galas. This role has helped me develop leadership and project coordination skills, while continuing to engage with financial topics and the broader ecosystem around the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have a strong preference for trading rolesâ€”where I find the intellectual challenge most rewardingâ€”I remain open to exploring a wide range of front-office positions, including sales, structuring, and quant research. I see this stage of my career as a time to learn intensively, grow quickly, and expose myself to diverse market perspectives. I bring a solid technical foundation, but more importantly, a strong work ethic, a collaborative mindset, and the curiosity needed to thrive and adapt on a dynamic trading floor.
